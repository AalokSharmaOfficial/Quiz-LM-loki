      "analysis_incorrect": "The question and options are slightly imprecise. The trade that was directly affected was the one controlled by the Sassanian Persians, who acted as middlemen between India/China and the Byzantine Empire. When the Byzantines learned to produce silk themselves, it broke the Persian monopoly. This would have had a knock-on effect on the **Indo-Persian trade (B)** in silk, as their primary European market was disrupted. The term **Indo-Byzantine trade (D)** is also relevant as the direct demand for Indian silk in Byzantium would have decreased. Historically, the biggest loser was the Persian empire's role in the trade.",
      "analysis_correct": "‚úÖ Why Indo-Byzantine trade was affected\n\n- Before the 6th century CE, the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was a major consumer of silk, which it imported at great expense from the East (China and India), largely through Persian intermediaries. According to legend, Byzantine monks smuggled silkworm eggs out of China, allowing the empire to start its own silk industry. This reduced its dependence on imports, thereby negatively affecting the long-distance silk trade from India and China.",
      "conclusion": "üìù Concluding Note\n\n- This event is a classic example of how technological transfer (in this case, sericulture) can drastically alter global trade patterns.",
      "fact": "üí° Interesting Fact\n\n- The Sassanian Persians and the Byzantines were major rivals, and the control of the lucrative silk trade was a significant point of conflict between the two empires."

The main streets ran from north to south and east to west, intersecting at right angles and dividing the city into large rectangular blocks. This demonstrates a high degree of planning and centralized design before the city was built.",
